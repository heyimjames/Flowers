## Adding Testers

### Internal Testing (Recommended for First Tests)
Internal testing is perfect for your team and doesn't require Apple review.

1. In TestFlight, click **Internal Testing** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **+** button next to "Testers"
3. Add team members who have access to your App Store Connect account
4. They'll receive an email invitation immediately

**Limits**: Up to 100 internal testers

### External Testing (For Broader Testing)
External testing requires Apple review but allows more testers.

1. Click **External Testing** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add External Testers**
3. You can either:
   - **Add individual testers**: Enter names and email addresses
   - **Create a public link**: Share with anyone to join your beta

**For Individual Testers:**
1. Click **Add New Testers**
2. Enter tester details (name and email)
3. Click **Add**

**For Public Link:**
1. Click **Create Public Link**
2. Set criteria (optional):
   - Device type (iPhone, iPad)
   - iOS version requirements
3. Set a tester limit
4. Click **Create**
5. Share the link via email, social media, etc.

**Limits**: Up to 10,000 external testers

### First External Build Review
- Your first external build requires Apple review
- Usually takes 24-48 hours
- Subsequent builds often skip review

## Managing Your Beta Test

### Monitoring Feedback
1. Check the **Feedback** section in TestFlight regularly
2. Testers can submit feedback with screenshots directly from the TestFlight app
3. View crash reports and usage metrics

### Updating Your Beta
1. Make changes in Xcode
2. Increment the build number (keep version the same for beta updates)
3. Archive and upload again
4. The new build automatically becomes available to testers

### Build Expiration
- TestFlight builds expire after **90 days**
- Testers receive notifications before expiration
- Upload new builds regularly to maintain testing

### Best Practices
1. **Start with internal testing** to catch major issues
2. **Provide clear testing instructions** in the "What to Test" field
3. **Respond to feedback promptly** to keep testers engaged
4. **Update builds regularly** based on feedback
5. **Use build numbers wisely** (1, 2, 3... for each upload)

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### "No eligible devices" error
- Ensure you're not selecting a simulator
- Choose "Any iOS Device" or a connected device

### Build not appearing in App Store Connect
- Wait 20-30 minutes for processing
- Check your email for any error notifications
- Ensure your Apple Developer account is active

### Cannot add external testers
- Make sure you've provided all required test information
- Your first build needs Apple review before adding external testers

### Testers can't install the app
- Verify they have iOS 14 or later (based on your app's requirements)
- Ensure they've installed the TestFlight app first
- Check if the build has expired (90-day limit)

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with TestFlight:
1. Gather and implement feedback
2. Polish your app based on tester input
3. Prepare for App Store submission
4. Create App Store screenshots and descriptions
5. Submit for App Store review
