# Flowers App PRD

## Overview
Flowers is a beautiful iOS app that delivers daily flower discoveries to users. Each day at a random time between 8am and 10:30pm, a new flower "blooms" and users receive a notification. The app acts as a digital flower field guide where users gradually build their collection by discovering one special flower per day.
